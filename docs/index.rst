The :py:mod:`sklearn:sklearn.metrics` module allows for the plotting of a confusion matrix from a
classifier (with :func:`sklearn:sklearn.metrics.plot_confusion_matrix`, or directly from a pre-computed confusion matrix (with the internal :class:`sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay` class).

A confusion matrix shows the discrepancy between the true labels of a dataset and the labels predicted by a classifier.

While the confusion matrix plots generated by Scikit-Learn are very informative, they omit important evaluation measures that can summarize classification performance. True positives, precision, F1 score and accuracy are example of such measures â€“ all of which can be derived from the confusion matrix. The :func:`sklearn.metrics.classification_report` function in the same module provides these measures.

Daze adjusts ``plot_confusion_matrix`` to incorporate these evaluation measures directly in the confusion matrix plot, while still maintaining a very similar API
to the original Scikit-Learn function.
